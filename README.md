# Steven Law â€” Web & AI Automations

**Learning by building real solutions for real clients.**

This is the landing page for my freelance work where I help businesses with web development and automation while finishing my CS degree. Using client projects as a way to learn, grow my skills, and self-sustain.

## What I Do

I take on freelance projects building:

- **High-performance websites** â€” Fast, modern, conversion-focused sites that actually generate leads
- **AI-powered automations** â€” Custom workflows that save businesses 10+ hours/week
- **Full-stack solutions** â€” End-to-end development from concept to deployment

Actively working with clients as a side income while finishing my degree. Every project is a learning opportunity to level up my technical skills and understand real-world business problems.

- **Backend:** Node.js, Python
- **AI/Automation:** LangChain, FastAPI, API integrations
- **Tools:** Next.js, Vite, PostgreSQL, Redis

## Current Work
